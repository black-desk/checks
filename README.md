# Github action checks for me

Just some github actions I would like to apply to ervey projects I own.

Currently contains these steps:

- no trailing spaces
- dependabot.yml up to date (using
  [update-dependabot](https://github.com/black-desk/update-dependabot))
- commitlint
- code formatting
  - cmake-format
  - clang-format
